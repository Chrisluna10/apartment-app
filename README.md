Chris Luna's Marketplace Project

How to run the project:
- git clone https://github.com/Chrisluna10/apartment-app.git
- cd apartment-app
- bundle install
- yarn install
- rails s

This Marketplace project was created to showcase my full-stack development skills with a React.js frontend and Ruby on Rails backend. I went off of OfferUp's website as inspiration for styling this application. In this Marketplace project, a user is able to create an account and utilize full CRUD functionality to post items for other users to see. I implemented devise, modified the controllers and added rails serializers to display specific information from the user when they post their item. I plan on creating a messaging feature between users to allow them to chat about the item and any other information that would be necessary for an online marketplace as well as a general location that the item was posted from. Thank you to those who took the time to look at my project. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
